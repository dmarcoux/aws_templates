Amazon Web Services templates I use in various projects.

## Setup

1. Install AWS Command Line Interface
   - On OS X with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install awscli`
   - On Linux, there should be a package for your distribution. Look at
     [pkgs.orgs](https://pkgs.org/) for `aws-cli` or `awscli`
2. Configure the AWS Command Line Interface by running `aws
      configure`. Details
      [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
